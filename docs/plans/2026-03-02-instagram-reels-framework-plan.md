# instagram-reels-framework Skill Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Create a Claude Code skill that generates production-ready Instagram Reel scripts with research-backed hook taxonomy, beat structures, emotional arcs, and a 12-point scoring rubric. Brand-first workflow with Unstuck preset.

**Architecture:** Single SKILL.md file packaged as a .skill archive. Three-phase workflow: Phase 1 presents known brands, gathers topic/goal, and researches the niche. Phase 2 presents hook types, beat structures, and emotional arcs for user selection. Phase 3 generates a complete Reel package (timed script, screenshot line, caption, filming notes) and scores it with a 12-point rubric. Brand-agnostic core with auto-applied Unstuck preset. Delegates voice to brand-voice-router and text quality to humanize-ai-writing.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown (SKILL.md), ZIP packaging (.skill format)

---

### Task 1: Write the SKILL.md frontmatter and trigger description

**Files:**
- Create: `~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Create the directory**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework
```

**Step 2: Write the frontmatter**

Create `~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md` with:

```markdown
---
name: instagram-reels-framework
description: Generate production-ready Instagram Reel scripts with research-backed hooks, beat structures, emotional arcs, and a 12-point scoring rubric. Use when user wants to create a Reel script, improve Reels performance, or develop short-form video content strategy. Trigger on phrases like "Reel script," "hook for a Reel," "filming notes," "content for Instagram," "my Reels aren't performing," "short-form video script," "Instagram content," "Reel hook," "content scoring," or any request to create, improve, or evaluate Instagram Reel content. Also use when user shares an existing Reel idea for quality scoring. Works for any brand — pairs with brand-voice-router for voice and humanize-ai-writing for output polish.

After the frontmatter, add:

```markdown
# Instagram Reels Framework

## What This Skill Does

Takes any brand and topic and generates a single production-ready Instagram Reel script — timed to the second, with filming notes, a screenshot line engineered for Story sharing, caption copy, and a 12-point quality score. Research-backed: every Reel is built from a specific hook type, beat structure, and emotional arc chosen for the brand's niche and goal.

This is not generic content advice. This is a script your creator can film today with exact timing, visual direction, and a score that tells you where it's weak before you post.

## Phase 1: Brand + Niche Research

### Step 1: Brand Check

Before anything else, check for known brands (brand-voice-router, brand-guidelines, any brand context in the project).

**If brands are found:**
Present them: "Here are the brands I know about: [list]. Which one is this Reel for? Or is this a new brand?"

**If the user picks an existing brand:**
Pull: niche, audience description, voice guidelines, vocabulary constraints (banned words, approved terminology). Summarize what you found so the user can confirm.

**If the user says "new brand" or no brands are found:**
Ask 3 quick questions (one at a time, wait for each answer):
1. "What's the brand name and what does it do?" (1-2 sentences)
2. "Who's the target audience?" (demographics, psychographics, situation)
3. "How should the brand sound?" (voice characteristics, any words to avoid)

Or, if brand-voice-router is available, delegate to it and use the output.

### Step 2: Topic + Goal

Ask two questions (one at a time):

**"What topic is this Reel about?"**
If the user is vague, suggest 2-3 topics based on the brand's niche and audience. The topic should be specific enough to script — "productivity" is too broad, "why your to-do list makes you less productive" is scriptable.

*If stuck, ask:* "What's the one thing your audience complains about most right now? Or what question do they keep asking you?"

**"What's the primary goal for this Reel?"**
Present the options:
- **Follows** — grow the audience (Identity Call-Out hooks work best)
- **Shares** — reach new people through audience distribution (Contrarian Reframe, Painfully Accurate Observation)
- **Saves** — become a reference resource (Framework Drop, Data/Stat Lead)
- **Comments** — drive engagement and conversation (Question Hook)
- **DM Conversions** — move to private conversation (only for conversion-focused content, never for vulnerability Reels)

*If stuck, ask:* "If this Reel performed perfectly, what would you see? More followers? People sharing it? People saving it for later? Or people DMing you?"

### Step 3: Niche Research

Research what's working in the brand's niche right now. Use web search to find:
- What top creators in this niche are posting (hook styles, formats, topics)
- Trending angles or conversations in this space
- Common hooks that are overused (to avoid them)
- Engagement patterns: what gets shared vs. what gets saved vs. what gets comments

**Summarize findings as a brief:**
- "Here's what I found in [niche]:"
- 3-5 bullet points on competitor approaches and trending content
- 1-2 hooks or angles that are overused (avoid these)
- 1-2 opportunities: gaps competitors aren't covering or fresh angles

### Phase 1 Output: Strategy Brief

Present a summary:
- **Brand:** [name] — [voice summary]
- **Audience:** [who they are]
- **Topic:** [specific topic]
- **Goal:** [primary goal]
- **Niche Context:** [2-3 key findings from research]
- **Recommended Direction:** [1-2 sentences on the angle to take]

**Tell the user:** "Here's the strategy brief based on your brand and niche research. Does this direction feel right? Once you approve, I'll present hook, structure, and emotional arc options."

Wait for approval before moving to Phase 2.
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add overview and Phase 1 brand + niche research"
```

---

### Task 3: Write Phase 2 (Strategy Selection — hooks, beat structures, emotional arcs)

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the Strategy Selection section**

```markdown
## Phase 2: Strategy Selection

Based on the niche research and Reel goal, present the building blocks. Each Reel is assembled from one hook type + one beat structure + one emotional arc.

### Hook Types

**4 Core Hooks:**

**1. Identity Call-Out** — Drives follows
Names the audience directly. Makes them feel seen and understood. Works because people follow accounts that reflect who they are.
> Template: "If you're a [specific persona] who [specific behavior], this is going to hit different."
> Template: "Nobody talks about the [persona] who [hidden struggle]."

**2. Contrarian Reframe** — Drives shares
Challenges a widely held belief. Creates "I need to send this to someone" energy. Works because people share content that makes them look smart.
> Template: "The advice to [common advice] is actually keeping you [stuck/failing/behind]."
> Template: "Everyone says [popular belief]. Here's what they're not telling you."

**3. Painfully Accurate Observation** — Drives shares + saves
Describes a hyper-specific behavior the audience recognizes in themselves but has never heard articulated. The "I feel attacked" hook. Works because specificity creates intimacy.
> Template: "You know that thing where you [very specific behavior]? There's a reason for that."
> Template: "Tell me you're a [persona] without telling me you're a [persona]: [specific behavior]."

**4. Framework Drop** — Drives saves
Promises a system, structure, or mental model. People save what they want to reference later. Works because frameworks imply "this is the last time you need to think about this."
> Template: "The [number]-step system I use to [specific outcome] every [timeframe]."
> Template: "I stopped [common approach] and started using this framework instead."

**3 Advanced Hooks (optional — present these if the user wants more options or if niche research suggests they'd work well):**

**5. Story Opening** — Drives watch time
Opens with a moment that demands you know what happened next. Doesn't reveal the payoff. Works because humans are wired to finish stories.
> Template: "I was [specific moment in time] when [unexpected thing happened]."
> Template: "Last [time period], someone told me [provocative statement]. Here's what I did."

**6. Data/Stat Lead** — Drives saves
Leads with a specific, surprising number. Creates authority through precision. Works because specificity implies expertise.
> Template: "[X%] of [personas] [surprising statistic] — and most don't know why."
> Template: "I tracked [metric] for [timeframe]. The results changed how I [behavior]."

**7. Question Hook** — Drives comments
Opens with a question that's impossible not to answer mentally. Creates engagement because people comment to share their answer. Works because unanswered questions create tension.
> Template: "What would change if you [specific positive outcome]?"
> Template: "Be honest — when was the last time you [behavior they avoid]?"

### Recommendation Logic

Based on the Reel goal from Phase 1, recommend a hook:
- **Goal = Follows:** Recommend Identity Call-Out
- **Goal = Shares:** Recommend Contrarian Reframe or Painfully Accurate Observation
- **Goal = Saves:** Recommend Framework Drop or Data/Stat Lead
- **Goal = Comments:** Recommend Question Hook
- **Goal = DM Conversions:** Recommend Identity Call-Out or Framework Drop

Present the recommended hook and 1-2 alternatives. Let the user choose.

### Beat Structures

Each beat structure defines the Reel's rhythm — what happens when, and how long each section lasts.

**1. Rant to Reframe (40 seconds)**
Start frustrated, end with clarity. The "hot take that actually has depth" structure.
- Rant / Hot take (0-15s) — Express the frustration your audience feels. Raw energy.
- Pivot / "But here's the thing" (15-25s) — Reframe the rant into an insight.
- System / Reframe landing (25-35s) — Deliver the actionable takeaway.
- CTA (35-40s) — Clean close matched to goal.

**2. Story to System (45-60 seconds)**
Open with a personal moment, close with a framework. The "vulnerability to value" structure.
- Story opening (0-15s) — Specific moment, not backstory. Drop the listener into a scene.
- Tension / Turning point (15-30s) — What changed. The insight moment.
- System / Framework (30-50s) — What you built from the experience. Steps or principles.
- CTA (50-60s) — Clean close matched to goal.

**3. Problem-Agitate-Solve (30 seconds)**
Fast, punchy, no filler. The "speed run" structure.
- Problem (0-8s) — Name the pain in their words.
- Agitate (8-18s) — Make it worse. Show the hidden cost they haven't considered.
- Solve (18-25s) — One clear action, framework, or reframe.
- CTA (25-30s) — Clean close matched to goal.

**4. Listicle with Twist (45 seconds)**
Classic list format with one item that breaks the pattern. The "wait, what?" structure.
- Setup / Promise (0-5s) — "[Number] things [outcome]."
- Items 1-N (5-35s) — Each item is 5-7 seconds. Clear, punchy.
- Twist item (35-40s) — The last item subverts expectations or goes deeper.
- CTA (40-45s) — Clean close matched to goal.

**5. Before/After Reveal (50 seconds)**
Shows transformation. The "proof of concept" structure.
- Before state (0-15s) — Paint the picture of the problem. Specific and relatable.
- What changed (15-30s) — The mechanism, decision, or action that caused the shift.
- After state (30-45s) — The result. Tangible, specific, believable.
- CTA (45-50s) — Clean close matched to goal.

Recommend a beat structure based on the hook choice and niche research. Let the user choose.

### Emotional Arcs

Every effective Reel moves the viewer through an emotional state change. Pick one:

**1. Frustration -> Validation -> Agency**
Start by naming what's frustrating. Validate that the frustration is reasonable (not their fault). End by giving them a tool to change it. Best for: Identity Call-Out hooks, Rant to Reframe beats.

**2. Confusion -> Clarity -> Confidence**
Start by naming what's confusing about the topic. Cut through the noise with a clear explanation. End by making them feel capable. Best for: Framework Drop hooks, Problem-Agitate-Solve beats.

**3. Shame -> Permission -> Pride**
Start by naming the thing they feel bad about. Give them explicit permission to stop feeling bad. End by reframing the behavior as a strength. Best for: Painfully Accurate Observation hooks, Story to System beats.

Recommend an emotional arc based on the hook + beat combination. Let the user choose.

### Phase 2 Output: Strategy Selections

Summarize the chosen combination:
- **Hook Type:** [name] — [template being used]
- **Beat Structure:** [name] — [timing]
- **Emotional Arc:** [name] — [state movement]

**Tell the user:** "Here's your Reel blueprint: [hook] + [beat structure] + [emotional arc]. Does this combination feel right? Once you approve, I'll generate the full script with filming notes and scoring."

Wait for approval before moving to Phase 3.
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Phase 2 strategy selection with hooks, beats, and arcs"
```

### Task 4: Write Phase 3 — Script Generation (timed script, screenshot line, caption, filming notes)

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the Script Generation section**

```markdown
## Phase 3: Script Generation + Scoring

Using the approved strategy selections, generate the complete Reel package.

### Timed Script

Every Reel uses this format. The script is timed to the second — each row maps to a segment the creator can film.

| Time | Script | Visual / Filming Notes |
|------|--------|----------------------|
| 0-3s | "[Hook line — exact words to say]" | [Camera setup, energy level, setting, any props] |
| 3-Xs | "[Body — exact words for this segment]" | [Visual direction, B-roll, transitions, gestures] |
| ... | ... | ... |
| Xs-End | "[Closing + CTA — exact words]" | [Final visual direction, energy shift] |

**Timed Script Rules:**
- **Word count must match timing.** Average speaking pace is 150 words/minute (~2.5 words/second). A 3-second hook fits ~7 words max. Count every row.
- **Write for speaking, not reading.** Use contractions. Short sentences. Conversational rhythm. Read it out loud in your head — if it sounds like an essay, rewrite it.
- **Visual/Filming Notes must be actionable.** Not "look confident" — instead "direct to camera, slight lean forward, hands visible, natural lighting." Specific enough for someone to set up the shot.
- **Energy notes matter.** Mark where energy should shift: "calm and conversational here," "increase pace," "pause for 1 beat after this line," "this line is the loudest moment."
- **Match beat structure timing.** If the user chose Rant to Reframe (40s), the script must fit 40 seconds. Don't drift.

### Screenshot Line

Engineer one line from the script that works as a standalone screenshot. This is the line people will share to their Instagram Story with a "watch this Reel" tag.

**Screenshot Line Rules:**
- Must be understandable without any context from the rest of the Reel
- Must be provocative, validating, or insight-dense enough to share
- Should be 8-15 words (fits cleanly in a Story screenshot)
- Mark it clearly in the timed script with **[SCREENSHOT LINE]**

### Caption

Write full caption copy to accompany the Reel post:

**Hook Line:** The first line of the caption — this is what shows before "...more." Must work as a standalone scroll-stopper. Often a variation of the Reel's hook, adapted for text.

**Body:** 2-4 sentences expanding on the Reel's core insight. Not a transcript — adds context, depth, or a different angle than the video.

**CTA:** Must match the Reel's primary goal from Phase 1:
- **Goal = Follows:** "Follow for more [topic] content" or "I post about [topic] every [frequency]"
- **Goal = Shares:** "Tag someone who needs to hear this" or "Share this with your [persona] friend"
- **Goal = Saves:** "Save this for when you need it" or "Bookmark this [framework/system]"
- **Goal = Comments:** "Tell me in the comments: [specific question]" or "Drop a [emoji] if this is you"
- **Goal = DM Conversions:** "DM me [keyword] for [specific resource]"

**Hashtags:** 5-8 hashtags. Mix of:
- 1-2 broad (100K+ posts): reach
- 3-4 niche (10K-100K posts): targeting
- 1-2 micro (under 10K posts): community

### Filming Notes

Separate from the timed script's per-row notes, provide overall filming guidance:

- **Energy:** Overall energy level and any shifts (e.g., "Start at 7/10 energy, drop to 4/10 for the vulnerable section, end at 8/10")
- **Setting:** Recommended environment (e.g., "desk setup with natural light" or "walking outdoors for casual energy")
- **Wardrobe/Props:** If relevant to the hook or beat structure
- **Pacing:** Where to speak faster, where to pause, where to let a beat land
- **Eye line:** Direct to camera, or looking away for specific moments
- **Multiple takes guidance:** Which sections need the most takes (usually the hook and the screenshot line)
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Phase 3 script generation with timed format, screenshot line, caption, filming notes"
```

### Task 5: Write the 12-Point Scoring Rubric

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the scoring rubric section**

```markdown
### 12-Point Scoring Rubric

After generating the Reel package, score it. Show the full breakdown to the user — don't summarize or hide weak scores.

Rate each dimension 1-10. Be honest. A score of 8+ requires specific justification — don't inflate.

**1. Hook Strength (1-10)**
Does the first 3 seconds stop the scroll? Is there a reason to keep watching? A 10 is "I physically cannot scroll past this." A 5 is "I might watch if I'm bored."

**2. Identity Mirror (1-10)**
Does the viewer see themselves in this Reel? Does it reflect a gap, behavior, or feeling they recognize but haven't heard articulated? A 10 is "I feel personally called out." A 5 is "this is generally relatable."

**3. Brand Voice (1-10)**
Does it sound like this brand? No banned words used? Vocabulary matches guidelines? A 10 is "unmistakably this person/brand." A 5 is "could be anyone in this niche."

**4. Shareability (1-10)**
Is there a screenshot-worthy moment? Would someone send this to a friend or share to their Story? A 10 is "I've already screenshotted this." A 5 is "I enjoyed it but won't share it."

**5. Emotional Arc (1-10)**
Does the viewer's emotional state change from start to finish? Can you name the before and after feeling? A 10 is "I started frustrated and ended empowered." A 5 is "I felt the same throughout."

**6. Timing (1-10)**
Does the script fit the chosen beat structure's target length? Is the pacing natural — no rushed sections, no dead air? A 10 is "every second earns its place." A 5 is "some sections drag or feel crammed."

**7. Specificity (1-10)**
Are there real anchors — specific numbers, scenarios, behaviors, examples? Or is it generic advice that applies to everyone and therefore resonates with no one? A 10 is "this references exact situations I've been in." A 5 is "this is true but vague."

**8. Ending Quality (1-10)**
Does the Reel land cleanly? No trailing off, no preaching, no "and that's why you should..." moralizing? A 10 is "the last line lands and I want to rewatch." A 5 is "it kind of fizzled out."

**9. CTA Alignment (1-10)**
Does the call to action match the Reel's primary goal? A vulnerability Reel asking for DMs is a mismatch. A framework Reel asking for saves is aligned. A 10 is "the CTA is the natural next step." A 5 is "the CTA feels bolted on."

**10. Vulnerability / Authenticity (1-10)**
Does this feel genuine? Could a real human say this without feeling performative? Is there something at stake for the creator? A 10 is "this took courage to post." A 5 is "this is safe content."

**11. System Visibility (1-10)**
If the Reel mentions a system, method, or framework — are the actual steps shown? Not just "I have a system" but "here are the 3 steps." If no system is mentioned, score based on whether the insight is concrete enough to act on. A 10 is "I can implement this today." A 5 is "interesting but what do I do with this?"

**12. Differentiation (1-10)**
Could only THIS brand make this Reel? Or could any creator in this niche say the same thing? A 10 is "this is unmistakably [brand name]." A 5 is "a generic content coach could post this."

### Scoring Output

Present the full rubric as a table:

| # | Dimension | Score | Notes |
|---|-----------|-------|-------|
| 1 | Hook Strength | X/10 | [Brief justification] |
| 2 | Identity Mirror | X/10 | [Brief justification] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |
| 12 | Differentiation | X/10 | [Brief justification] |
| | **Total** | **XX/120** | |

**Flag any dimension scoring below 7.** For each flagged dimension, provide a specific fix suggestion — not "make it better" but "change the hook from [current] to [proposed] because [reason]."

**Tell the user:** "Here's the score breakdown. [N] dimensions flagged for improvement. Want me to revise the script to address the flagged items, or is this ready to film?"
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add 12-point scoring rubric with flag-and-fix system"
```

---

### Task 6: Write the Unstuck Preset, guardrails, and scope boundaries

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the Unstuck Preset, Rules, and scope sections**

```markdown
## Unstuck Preset

When the brand is "Unstuck," auto-apply these constraints. The user does not need to answer the brand questions in Phase 1 — this preset provides the answers.

**Audience:** High-earning PMs, founders, and operators who are great at building other people's products but stuck on their own side projects. They give excellent team advice they can't follow themselves.

**Voice:**
- PM terminology over generic coaching language (sprints, scope, shipping, retros — not "journeys" or "transformations")
- Vulnerability over motivation. Show the struggle, not just the win.
- Systems over willpower. "Here's the process" not "just believe in yourself."
- Conversational and direct. Write how a smart PM talks to a friend, not how a coach talks to a client.

**Banned Words:** journey, unlock, transform, elevate, empower, level up, crush it, hustle, grind, or any generic coaching/motivational language. These are hard filters — if they appear in the script, it fails the Brand Voice scoring dimension.

**Identity Mirrors:** The gap between how they help their team and how they treat their own projects. They can scope a product for 50 engineers but can't decide what to build on a Saturday. They run retros at work but haven't reflected on their side project in months.

**Differentiation Test:** "Could a fitness coach or generic content creator say this? If yes, it's too generic for Unstuck." Every Reel must pass this test — if the content could come from any self-improvement account, it doesn't belong.

**Default Emotional Arc:** Shame -> Permission -> Pride (most Unstuck content addresses the shame of being "capable but stuck").

## Rules

- **Brand voice constraints are hard filters.** Banned words are banned. If a banned word appears in a generated script, remove it and find a better word. This is not a suggestion — it's a constraint.
- **Never fabricate engagement data or competitor stats.** If niche research finds specific numbers, use them with attribution. If you can't find real data, say "based on common patterns in [niche]" not "studies show" or "data suggests."
- **CTA must match Reel goal.** A vulnerability Reel about feeling stuck should not end with "DM me for coaching." A framework Reel about a productivity system can ask for saves. If the CTA doesn't match, the CTA Alignment score should reflect it.
- **Script timing must be realistic.** 150 words per minute. ~2.5 words per second. If the script has 100 words and the beat structure targets 30 seconds, the math works. If it has 100 words targeting 20 seconds, cut the script — don't pretend people talk faster.
- **Screenshot line must work standalone.** If someone screenshots that one line and shares it with zero context, it must still be interesting, provocative, or validating. If it requires the Reel to make sense, pick a different line.
- **Self-scoring must be honest.** A score of 9 or 10 on any dimension requires specific, concrete justification. "This is really good" is not justification. "The hook uses the exact phrase the audience uses in their own DMs" is. When in doubt, score lower.
- **Filming notes must be specific enough to execute.** Not "film with energy" — instead "direct to camera, lean slightly forward, speaking pace 10% faster than conversational, pause for one beat after the hook before continuing." A creator should be able to read the notes and set up the shot without asking questions.
- **Humanize all text output.** If humanize-ai-writing is available, run all scripts and captions through it. If humanize-ai-writing is not available, write in a natural, conversational tone — avoid generic AI phrasing, corporate speak, or motivational cliches.
- **Apply brand voice when available.** If brand-voice-router is active or the user specified a brand, apply that voice to all scripts, captions, and filming notes. If no brand context exists, write in clear, direct, conversational tone.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Edit or produce actual video content (this generates scripts, not videos)
- Schedule or post to Instagram (use a scheduling tool for that)
- Manage ad campaigns (that's funnel-ad-creator)
- Write carousel or static post copy (Reels and short-form video scripts only)
- Replace a content strategy or content calendar (creates individual Reels, one at a time)
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Unstuck preset, guardrails, and scope boundaries"
```

---

### Task 7: Package as .skill archive and verify

**Files:**
- Create: `~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/instagram-reels-framework.skill`

**Step 1: Verify the archive format matches existing skills**

Check the structure of an existing .skill archive:

```bash
unzip -l ~/skills/skills/humanize-ai-writing/humanize-ai-writing.skill
```

The format stores files inside a named subdirectory (e.g., `humanize-ai-writing/SKILL.md`).

**Step 2: Package the SKILL.md into a .skill ZIP archive**

```bash
cd /tmp
mkdir instagram-reels-framework
cp ~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md instagram-reels-framework/
zip -r ~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/instagram-reels-framework.skill instagram-reels-framework/
rm -rf instagram-reels-framework
```

**Step 3: Verify the archive contents**

```bash
unzip -l ~/skills/skills/instagram-reels-framework/instagram-reels-framework.skill
```

Expected output should show `instagram-reels-framework/SKILL.md` inside the archive.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/instagram-reels-framework/
git commit -m "feat: package instagram-reels-framework skill"
```

---

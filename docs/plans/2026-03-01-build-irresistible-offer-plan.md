# build-irresistible-offer Skill Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Create a Claude Code skill that builds high-converting offers using the Irresistible Offer Formula, outputting a structured blueprint document.

**Architecture:** Single SKILL.md file packaged as a .skill archive. Skill opens with 8 Offer Clarity Questions (collaborative — helps user if stuck), then generates a 7-section structured blueprint. Brand-agnostic; delegates voice to brand-voice-router and humanize-ai-writing.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown (SKILL.md), ZIP packaging (.skill format)

---

### Task 1: Write the SKILL.md frontmatter and trigger description

**Files:**
- Create: `~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Create the directory**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer
```

**Step 2: Write the frontmatter**

Create `~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md` with:

```markdown
---
name: build-irresistible-offer
description: Build high-converting offers using the Irresistible Offer Formula with value stacking, named IP, guarantees, and urgency mechanics. Use when user wants to create, rebuild, or improve any paid offer — mentions low conversions, pricing strategy, value stacking, guarantee structure, or is launching a new product. Also use when user shares an existing offer for evaluation. Trigger on phrases like "make my offer better," "nobody's buying," "how do I price this," "what should I charge," "I need a guarantee," "my offer isn't converting," or any request to build or fix a paid product/service offering. Works for any brand — pairs with brand-voice-router for voice and humanize-ai-writing for output polish.

```

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add build-irresistible-offer skill frontmatter"
```

---

### Task 2: Write the skill overview and Offer Clarity Questions section

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the overview and questions section**

After the frontmatter, add:

```markdown
# Build Irresistible Offer

## What This Skill Does

Takes any paid offer — new or existing — and rebuilds it into something people feel stupid saying no to. Uses the Irresistible Offer Formula: maximize dream outcome, speed, and certainty while eliminating perceived risk. Outputs a complete offer blueprint with value stack, named IP, guarantee structure, urgency mechanics, and selling statements.

This is not copywriting. This is offer architecture. The copy comes after.

## Phase 1: Offer Clarity Questions

Ask these questions one at a time. Wait for the user's answer before moving to the next.

**If the user is stuck on any question:** Don't just repeat it. Help them think through it — suggest options based on what they've already told you, offer examples from common patterns, or reframe the question. The goal is to get a real answer, not a placeholder.

**If the user truly can't answer one** (e.g., no proof exists yet for a new offer), note it as a gap and keep moving. Flag it in Section 7 of the blueprint.

### The 8 Questions

**Q1: "What specific transformation does your client achieve?"**
Not features. Not deliverables. The before → after. What is true about their life/business/situation after working with you that wasn't true before?

*If stuck, ask:* "If your best client wrote a text to a friend 6 months after finishing, what would they say changed?" or "What would they be doing differently that they aren't doing now?"

**Q2: "How fast do they get there?"**
Timeline matters. Same outcome in 6 weeks vs 6 months is a different offer. Be specific — not "quickly" but "within 6 weeks" or "first result in 48 hours."

*If stuck, ask:* "When does the first noticeable result happen? Not the full transformation — the first sign it's working."

**Q3: "What makes them certain it'll work for them specifically?"**
This is about proof of mechanism. Your method, your credentials, your track record, your framework. Why should they believe YOUR approach works, not just that the outcome is possible?

*If stuck, ask:* "What's different about how you do this compared to everyone else? What's your unfair advantage or unique method?"

**Q4: "What risk are they taking by saying yes?"**
Financial risk (the price), time risk (wasted effort), reputation risk (looking foolish), opportunity cost (what else they could spend this on). Name all of them — you need to address each one.

*If stuck, ask:* "What would a skeptical version of your ideal client say is the reason NOT to buy?"

**Q5: "Why should they act now instead of later?"**
Real urgency, not manufactured. Cost of waiting, limited capacity, seasonal relevance, price changes, competitive window closing. If there's no real urgency, that's a gap to address.

*If stuck, ask:* "What gets worse for them every week they don't solve this? What's the cost of inaction?"

**Q6: "What proof do you have that this works?"**
Testimonials, case studies, your own results, data, before/after, published work, credentials. List everything. For new offers with no proof yet, what adjacent proof exists? (Your own story, related results, credentials that transfer.)

*If stuck, ask:* "Even if you haven't done this exact offer before — what have you done that proves you can deliver this outcome?"

**Q7: "Who is this explicitly NOT for?"**
Disqualification sharpens positioning. Name the people who should not buy this. This makes the right people feel more seen.

*If stuck, ask:* "Who would waste your time and theirs if they bought this? Who do you dread working with?"

**Q8: "What's the price, and where does this sit in your product ladder?"**
Entry ($10-$100), core ($500-$5,000), premium ($5,000-$50,000+), or continuity (monthly). What comes before it? What comes after? Is there a gap in the ladder?

*If stuck, ask:* "What's the cheapest version of this you could sell? What's the most expensive? Where does this one sit between those?"
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add offer clarity questions with collaborative guidance"
```

### Task 3: Write the Blueprint Generation section

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the blueprint generation instructions**

```markdown
## Phase 2: Generate the Offer Blueprint

After gathering all 8 answers, generate a structured document with these 7 sections. Use the user's answers as raw material — don't just repeat their words back. Synthesize, sharpen, and fill gaps.

### Section 1: Offer Formula Score

Apply the formula: **(Dream Outcome × Speed × Certainty) ÷ Risk**

Rate each factor 1-10 based on the user's answers:
- **Dream Outcome (1-10):** How desirable is the transformation? Is it specific and vivid?
- **Speed (1-10):** How fast? Faster = higher score. Vague timeline = low score.
- **Certainty (1-10):** How much proof exists? Named method + testimonials + credentials = high. "Trust me" = low.
- **Risk (1-10):** 10 = maximum risk (high price, no guarantee, unknown provider). 1 = minimal risk.

Show the math. Identify the weakest lever and recommend how to improve it.

Example:
> **Dream Outcome:** 8/10 — Specific (shipped product in 6 weeks), emotionally resonant
> **Speed:** 9/10 — Clear timeline, first result in week 1
> **Certainty:** 6/10 — Strong credentials but only 3 testimonials
> **Risk:** 4/10 — $4,500 with guarantee reduces perceived risk
> **Score:** (8 × 9 × 6) ÷ 4 = **108** — Strong. Weakest lever: Certainty. Get 5 more testimonials.

### Section 2: Value Stack

Build a table with every deliverable component. For each:
- Name the component
- Assign a market-rate dollar value
- Justify that value (what would this cost if bought separately?)

**Rules:**
- Dollar values must reflect actual market rates, not fantasy numbers
- Include the core offer components AND bonus assets
- Bonuses should have high perceived value but low fulfillment cost (templates, frameworks, recordings, tools — not more of your time)
- Total perceived value should be 3-5x the actual price
- If the ratio is below 3x, recommend additional components or bonuses

Format as a table:

| Component | Description | Market Value |
|-----------|-------------|-------------|
| [Name] | [What it is and what they get] | $X,XXX |
| ... | ... | ... |
| **Total Perceived Value** | | **$XX,XXX** |
| **Your Price** | | **$X,XXX** |
| **Value Ratio** | | **X.Xx** |

### Section 3: Named IP

Transform every generic process component into named intellectual property.

**Rules:**
- Format: "The [Memorable Name]™"
- The name should imply the mechanism or outcome — not just sound clever
- Every core deliverable gets a name. Support elements can stay generic.
- Don't name everything — over-naming dilutes impact. 3-6 named components is the sweet spot.

For each named component, provide:
- **The name**
- **What it replaces** (the generic version)
- **Why this name works** (what it implies about the mechanism or outcome)

Example:
> **The Scope Guillotine™** replaces "scope definition process." Implies decisive, permanent cutting — no scope creep, no "maybe later." The violence of the metaphor signals that this is about ruthless prioritization.

### Section 4: Guarantee + Anti-Guarantee

Build a dual guarantee structure:

**The Guarantee (positive promise):**
State the specific outcome you guarantee. Not "you'll be satisfied" — the actual transformation. "You will ship your V1 within 6 weeks" or "You will have a complete, conversion-ready offer blueprint."

**The Anti-Guarantee (client conditions):**
List 3-7 specific, binary, trackable conditions the client must meet for the guarantee to apply.

**Rules for conditions:**
- Each must be yes/no verifiable (not subjective)
- Each must be within the client's control
- Each must be reasonable (don't create impossible hoops)
- Include attendance/participation, deadline adherence, communication requirements, and scope adherence

**State the consequence:** What happens if they meet all conditions and don't get the outcome? Full refund, extended service, partial refund, credit toward next tier? Be specific.

**Example:**
> I guarantee you will ship your V1 within 6 weeks if you:
> 1. Attend 100% of scheduled sessions
> 2. Submit weekly check-ins by Sunday at midnight
> 3. Complete sprint tasks by each deadline
> 4. Adhere to your locked scope (no feature additions)
> 5. Communicate blockers within 24 hours
>
> If you do all five and don't ship, I continue working with you at no cost until you do.

### Section 5: Urgency Mechanics

Design real urgency — never manufactured. Three components:

**1. Fast Action Bonus**
An asset that increases perceived value without adding fulfillment time. Something you've already created or can create once and give to everyone. High perceived value, zero marginal cost.

- Name the bonus
- Assign a dollar value (market rate)
- Set the decision window (24-72 hours after sales call/pitch)

**2. Decision Window**
After a sales call or pitch, hold the spot for a specific number of hours. Not a fake countdown — a real hold because your capacity is limited.

**3. Scarcity (only if real)**
If you have genuine capacity limits (e.g., "I take 3-5 clients per month"), state them. If you don't, skip this. Fake scarcity destroys trust with sophisticated buyers.

**Rules:**
- Never manufacture urgency that doesn't exist
- Always give a reason WHY the deadline matters (capacity, cohort start date, price change, bonus availability)
- The fast action bonus should be something you'd actually sell separately

### Section 6: Selling Statements

Write 3-5 one-paragraph descriptions of the offer for different contexts. Each hits a different angle but communicates the same core value.

Write one for each:
1. **Sales page hero** — The 2-3 sentence version that sits above the fold. Outcome-first.
2. **Email pitch** — A paragraph you could drop into an email that explains the offer and creates desire.
3. **DM/conversation intro** — How you'd explain this to someone who just said "tell me more" in a DM. Casual, direct.
4. **Ad copy** — A short paragraph for paid social. Hook + transformation + proof hint + CTA.
5. **Casual explanation** — How you'd describe this to a friend at dinner who asked "so what do you do?"

**Rules:**
- If brand-voice-router is active, apply the detected brand voice
- All selling statements must be run through humanize-ai-writing before delivery
- Never fabricate proof, results, or testimonials in selling statements
- Each statement should stand alone — don't assume the reader saw the others

### Section 7: Offer Gaps & Recommendations

Audit the offer against these criteria and flag anything missing or weak:

- **Proof gaps:** Are there claims without supporting evidence? Flag them with [NEEDS PROOF].
- **Ladder gaps:** Does this offer connect to what comes before and after? Is there a price jump that loses people?
- **Guarantee enforceability:** Can you actually track the anti-guarantee conditions? Are they realistic?
- **Value stack ratio:** Is it below 3x? What could be added?
- **Urgency authenticity:** Is the urgency real or manufactured?
- **Disqualification clarity:** Is the "not for" specific enough to actually filter people?
- **Unanswered clarity questions:** Any questions from Phase 1 the user couldn't answer — list them here with recommendations.

For each gap, recommend a specific action to close it.
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add 7-section blueprint generation instructions"
```

### Task 4: Write the guardrails and integration rules

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append guardrails section**

```markdown
## Rules

- **Never fabricate proof.** Don't invent testimonials, case studies, results, or data. If proof doesn't exist, flag it as a gap.
- **Value stack amounts must be justifiable.** Every dollar value needs a market-rate basis. "A $5,000 value!" with no justification is the same move every bad offer makes.
- **Anti-guarantee conditions must be binary.** "Gave their best effort" is not trackable. "Submitted weekly check-in by Sunday midnight" is.
- **Don't design the sales page.** This skill produces the offer architecture. The sales page, funnel, and copy are downstream deliverables.
- **Don't write DM scripts.** Qualification scripts are a separate skill with different triggers and output format.
- **Apply brand voice when available.** If brand-voice-router is active or the user specifies a brand, selling statements should use that voice. If no brand context exists, write in clear, direct, professional tone.
- **Humanize all text output.** Run selling statements through humanize-ai-writing before delivering. The user's audience (especially senior tech professionals) will spot AI copy instantly.
- **One offer per blueprint.** If the user wants to build multiple offers, produce separate blueprints. Don't combine an offer ladder into one document — each tier gets its own blueprint.
- **Existing offers get the full treatment.** If the user shares an existing offer for evaluation, don't just critique it. Run it through the full framework and produce a complete blueprint showing what it should become.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Write sales page copy (that's copywriting, not offer architecture)
- Create DM qualification scripts (separate skill)
- Design email sequences or funnels (separate skill)
- Build the product itself
- Set up payment processing or delivery
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add guardrails and scope boundaries"
```

---

### Task 5: Package as .skill archive and verify

**Files:**
- Create: `~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/build-irresistible-offer.skill`

**Step 1: Package the SKILL.md into a .skill ZIP archive**

The .skill format is a ZIP containing `build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md`:

```bash
cd ~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer
zip build-irresistible-offer.skill -j SKILL.md
# Verify contents
unzip -l build-irresistible-offer.skill
```

Expected output should show SKILL.md inside the archive.

**Step 2: Verify the archive matches the format of existing skills**

```bash
unzip -l ~/skills/skills/humanize-ai-writing/humanize-ai-writing.skill
```

Compare the structure. If the existing skills store the SKILL.md inside a named subdirectory (e.g., `humanize-ai-writing/SKILL.md`), match that:

```bash
cd /tmp
mkdir build-irresistible-offer
cp ~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md build-irresistible-offer/
zip -r ~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/build-irresistible-offer.skill build-irresistible-offer/
rm -rf build-irresistible-offer
```

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/build-irresistible-offer/
git commit -m "feat: package build-irresistible-offer skill"
```

---

### Task 6: Final review — read the complete SKILL.md and verify quality

**Files:**
- Read: `~/skills/skills/build-irresistible-offer/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Read the full file and verify:**
- [ ] Frontmatter has correct name and comprehensive trigger description
- [ ] All 8 Offer Clarity Questions present with "if stuck" guidance
- [ ] All 7 blueprint sections present with rules and examples
- [ ] Guardrails section covers fabrication, value justification, binary conditions
- [ ] Scope boundaries clearly state what the skill does NOT do
- [ ] No references to specific brands (brand-agnostic)
- [ ] humanize-ai-writing and brand-voice-router mentioned as companions, not dependencies
- [ ] File reads well as standalone instructions — no context needed beyond the file itself

**Step 2: Fix any issues found**

**Step 3: Final commit if changes made**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/build-irresistible-offer/
git commit -m "fix: address review findings in build-irresistible-offer"
```

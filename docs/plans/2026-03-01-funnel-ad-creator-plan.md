# funnel-ad-creator Skill Implementation Plan

> **For Claude:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task.

**Goal:** Create a Claude Code skill that generates complete ad script bibles (12-16 storyboarded ads) for any product funnel using Hormozi frameworks, persona x pain matrices, 8 hook categories, and a 4-week testing protocol.

**Architecture:** Single SKILL.md file packaged as a .skill archive. Three-phase workflow: Phase 1 gathers product/audience context via 5 collaborative questions and outputs a Persona x Pain Point Matrix. Phase 2 generates hook variations using 8 hook categories. Phase 3 produces the full ad bible with storyboards across TOFU/MOFU/BOFU/Retargeting stages plus testing protocol. Brand-agnostic; delegates voice to brand-voice-router and humanize-ai-writing.

**Tech Stack:** Markdown (SKILL.md), ZIP packaging (.skill format)

---

### Task 1: Write the SKILL.md frontmatter and trigger description

**Files:**
- Create: `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Create the directory**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator
```

**Step 2: Write the frontmatter**

Create `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md` with:

```markdown
---
name: funnel-ad-creator
description: Generate complete ad script bibles for any product funnel using Hormozi value frameworks, persona x pain point matrices, and TOFU/MOFU/BOFU/Retargeting architecture. Use when user needs ad scripts, video ad creative, hook variations, or a full funnel ad strategy. Trigger on phrases like "I need ads for my funnel," "write ad scripts," "my ads aren't converting," "ad fatigue," "hook variations," "I need TOFU/MOFU/BOFU ads," "video ad scripts," "ad bible," or any request to create, improve, or systematize paid ad creative for a product or service. Also use when user shares existing ads for improvement. Works for any brand — pairs with brand-voice-router for voice and humanize-ai-writing for output polish.

```

**Step 3: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add funnel-ad-creator skill frontmatter"
```

---

### Task 2: Write the skill overview and Phase 1 (Product & Audience Discovery)

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the overview and Phase 1 section**

After the frontmatter, add:

```markdown
# Funnel Ad Creator

## What This Skill Does

Takes any product or service and generates a complete ad script bible — 12-16 production-ready storyboarded ads across all funnel stages (TOFU, MOFU, BOFU, Retargeting). Each ad includes full visual direction, scripted dialogue, text overlays, timing, and caption copy. Includes a 4-week testing protocol for deployment.

This is not generic ad copy. This is funnel-stage-specific ad architecture built on the Hormozi Value Equation: **(Dream Outcome x Perceived Likelihood of Achievement) / (Time Delay x Effort & Sacrifice).**

Every ad targets one persona, one pain point, one funnel stage. No multi-targeting. No vague audiences.

## Phase 1: Product & Audience Discovery

Ask these questions one at a time. Wait for the user's answer before moving to the next.

**If the user is stuck on any question:** Don't just repeat it. Help them think through it — suggest options based on what they've already told you, offer examples from their industry, or reframe the question. The goal is a real answer, not a placeholder.

**If the user truly can't answer one** (e.g., no testimonials yet for a new product), note it as a gap and keep moving. Flag it in the Gaps section of the ad bible.

### The 5 Questions

**Q1: "What does your product/service do, and what specific transformation does it deliver?"**
Not features. Not deliverables. The before -> after. What changes in their life, business, or situation? Be specific — "go from struggling to get clients to fully booked in 6 weeks" not "helps with marketing."

*If stuck, ask:* "Imagine your best customer texting a friend about what changed. What would they say?" or "What can they do now that they couldn't do before?"

**Q2: "Who are your 2-3 core audience personas?"**
Give each a name and describe: demographics (age, role, situation), psychographics (beliefs, fears, aspirations), and current state (what they're doing now that isn't working). These become the targeting foundation for every ad.

*If stuck, ask:* "Think of your last 3-5 best customers. What do they have in common? What situation were they in when they found you?" or offer archetypes: "The overwhelmed beginner? The stuck intermediate? The ambitious pro who needs a shortcut?"

**Q3: "What are the top 3 pain points for each persona?"**
Specific, emotional pain — not abstract problems. "Spending 4 hours a day on content that gets 12 likes" not "struggling with social media." Each persona may share some pain points but should have at least one unique to them.

*If stuck, ask:* "What do they complain about in DMs, comments, or on sales calls? What keeps them up at night about this problem?" or "What have they already tried that didn't work?"

**Q4: "What proof do you have that your solution works?"**
Testimonials, case studies, your own results, data, before/after, published work, credentials. List everything you have for each persona type. For new products with no proof yet, what adjacent proof exists? (Your own transformation, related results, credentials that transfer.)

*If stuck, ask:* "Even if this exact product is new — what have you done that proves you can deliver this outcome? Your own story counts."

**Q5: "What's your price point and where does this sit in your funnel?"**
What comes before this offer? (Free content, lead magnet, tripwire?) What comes after? (Upsell, premium tier, continuity?) This determines which funnel stages need the most ad weight and how aggressive the CTAs should be.

*If stuck, ask:* "What's the cheapest thing someone can buy from you? What's the most expensive? Where does this product sit between those?"

### Phase 1 Output: Persona x Pain Point Matrix

After gathering all 5 answers, synthesize them into a matrix. Don't just repeat the user's words — sharpen, fill gaps, and make each cell specific enough to write an ad from.

Present this table for user review:

| Persona | Pain Point | Desired Outcome | Proof Available | Funnel Stage Priority |
|---------|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| [Name + 1-line description] | [Specific, emotional pain] | [Specific transformation] | [Yes/No + what type] | [TOFU/MOFU/BOFU] |

**Rules for the matrix:**
- Each persona should have 2-3 pain points (6-9 rows total)
- "Proof Available" determines whether an ad can make a claim or must use a softer approach
- "Funnel Stage Priority" assigns where this persona x pain combo is most powerful
- If a cell feels vague, ask a follow-up question before proceeding

**Tell the user:** "Here's your Persona x Pain Point Matrix. Review it — edit anything that doesn't feel right. Once you approve, I'll generate hook variations for each ad."

Wait for approval before moving to Phase 2.
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Phase 1 discovery questions and persona matrix"
```

---

### Task 3: Write Phase 2 (Hook Bank Generation)

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the Hook Bank section**

```markdown
## Phase 2: Hook Bank Generation

Using the approved Persona x Pain Point Matrix, generate 3 hook variations for each planned ad. Hooks are the first 3 seconds — they determine whether someone watches or scrolls.

### The 8 Hook Categories

Each hook follows a fill-in-the-blank pattern. Use the persona and pain point data from the matrix to fill the variables.

**1. Callout Hook**
Directly names the audience. Makes them feel seen.
> "Hey [persona] — if you're still [pain point behavior], this is for you."
> "Every [persona] I talk to says the same thing: [common complaint]."

**2. Contrast Hook**
Shows the gap between what most people do and what actually works.
> "Most [personas] try to [common approach]. Here's why that keeps you stuck."
> "[Common advice] sounds smart. It's actually the reason you're [pain point]."

**3. Question Hook**
Opens a curiosity loop that demands an answer.
> "What if [pain point] wasn't something you had to live with?"
> "Why do some [personas] [achieve outcome] in [timeframe] while others struggle for years?"

**4. Myth-Bust Hook**
Attacks a belief the audience holds. Creates cognitive dissonance.
> "You've been told [common belief about solution]. That's the worst advice I've ever heard."
> "The [industry] is lying to you about [topic]. Here's what actually works."

**5. Story Hook**
Opens with a relatable moment. Creates emotional connection.
> "I was [relatable situation] when I realized [insight]."
> "Last [time period], a [persona] came to me with [specific problem]. Here's what happened."

**6. Data Hook**
Leads with a specific, surprising number. Creates authority.
> "[Specific number] of [personas] [surprising statistic] — and most don't even know why."
> "We tracked [metric] across [sample size]. The results changed everything."

**7. Identity Hook**
Speaks to who the viewer IS, not what they want. Tribal.
> "This is for the [persona] who [specific behavior that shows identity]."
> "If you're the kind of [persona] who [identity marker], keep watching."

**8. Absurdist Hook**
Pattern interrupt. Unexpected visual or statement that stops the scroll through sheer weirdness.
> "[Completely unexpected statement or visual that relates to the pain point in a non-obvious way]"
> Use sparingly — 1-2 per ad bible max. Works best for TOFU.

### Hook Assignment Rules

- Each ad gets 3 hook variations from 3 DIFFERENT categories
- No ad bible should use the same hook category more than 4 times total
- TOFU ads favor: Callout, Question, Absurdist, Identity
- MOFU ads favor: Data, Myth-Bust, Story, Contrast
- BOFU ads favor: Story, Data, Callout, Contrast
- Retargeting ads favor: Callout, Question, Story

### Phase 2 Output: Hook Bank

Present hooks organized by funnel stage and ad:

**TOFU Ad 1 — [Persona]: [Pain Point]**
- Hook A (Callout): "[Full hook text]"
- Hook B (Question): "[Full hook text]"
- Hook C (Identity): "[Full hook text]"

**TOFU Ad 2 — [Persona]: [Pain Point]**
...

**Tell the user:** "Here are your hook variations for each ad. Review them — swap any that don't feel right. Once you approve, I'll generate the full ad bible with storyboards."

Wait for approval before moving to Phase 3.
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Phase 2 hook bank with 8 categories and assignment rules"
```

### Task 4: Write Phase 3 — Ad Bible generation (funnel stage specs + storyboard format)

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the Ad Bible generation section**

```markdown
## Phase 3: Generate the Ad Bible

After hook approval, generate 12-16 ads across 4 funnel stages. Each ad is a complete, production-ready unit — storyboard, caption, and all three hook variations.

### Funnel Stage Architecture

#### TOFU — Top of Funnel (4 ads)

**Goal:** Stop the scroll. Create awareness. Make the viewer feel seen and understood. Do NOT sell — just identify the pain and hint that a solution exists.

**Audience:** Cold — has never heard of you. Skeptical by default.

**Ad Structure:**
1. **Hook** (0-3 seconds) — Pattern interrupt or pain identification. This is where the ad lives or dies.
2. **Pain Agitation** (3-13 seconds) — Twist the knife. Make the pain vivid and specific. Use their language, not yours.
3. **Solution Hint** (13-18 seconds) — Brief glimpse that a better way exists. Don't explain the mechanism yet.
4. **Soft CTA** (18-22 seconds) — "Follow for more" or "Link in bio" — low commitment ask.

**Length:** 15-30 seconds
**Kill Metric:** < 25% hook rate (percentage who watch past 3 seconds) -> kill the ad
**Visual Intensity:** Low-medium. Authentic, not polished. B-roll of relatable situations. Talking head works.

#### MOFU — Middle of Funnel (3 ads)

**Goal:** Build trust. Reveal the mechanism — WHY your approach works. Show proof. Move from "I have this problem" to "this person might be able to solve it."

**Audience:** Warm — has seen your TOFU content. Curious but not convinced.

**Ad Structure:**
1. **Hook** (0-3 seconds) — Reference the pain they already recognize (from TOFU exposure).
2. **Mechanism Reveal** (3-18 seconds) — Explain the unique approach. Name your method. Show how it works differently from what they've tried.
3. **Proof** (18-28 seconds) — Testimonial clip, screenshot, before/after, data point. Real proof, not claims.
4. **Value CTA** (28-35 seconds) — "Watch the free training" or "Download the guide" — lead magnet or content CTA.

**Length:** 30-60 seconds
**Kill Metric:** < 1% CTR (click-through rate) -> kill the ad
**Visual Intensity:** Medium. More produced than TOFU. Can include screen recordings, diagrams, testimonial clips.

#### BOFU — Bottom of Funnel (3 ads)

**Goal:** Overcome final objections. Make the value obvious. Drive the purchase or booking.

**Audience:** Hot — has consumed your content, visited your page, maybe started checkout. Needs a final push.

**Ad Structure:**
1. **Hook** (0-3 seconds) — Direct and urgent. Acknowledge they've been thinking about it.
2. **Value Stack** (3-18 seconds) — Rapid-fire: what they get, what it's worth, what they pay. Make the gap obvious.
3. **Guarantee / Risk Reversal** (18-25 seconds) — Remove the last objection. Guarantee the outcome or remove the financial risk.
4. **Urgency + Hard CTA** (25-30 seconds) — Real urgency (limited spots, price increase, cohort deadline). Direct CTA: "Enroll now" or "Book your call."

**Length:** 30-45 seconds
**Kill Metric:** < 2% conversion rate -> kill the ad
**Visual Intensity:** High. Polished. Value stack graphics, countdown energy, testimonial montage.

#### Retargeting (3 ads)

**Goal:** Re-engage people who saw your content or visited your page but didn't convert. Different angle, not the same pitch again.

**Audience:** Hottest — already knows you, already interested, something stopped them.

**Ad Structure:**
1. **Acknowledgment Hook** (0-3 seconds) — "Hey, you watched my video about [topic]..." or "I noticed you checked out [product]..."
2. **New Angle** (3-15 seconds) — Different proof point, different testimonial, different objection addressed. Do NOT repeat the original pitch.
3. **Time-Limited CTA** (15-22 seconds) — Specific deadline or bonus that creates real urgency to act now.

**Length:** 15-30 seconds
**Kill Metric:** < 3% conversion rate -> kill the ad
**Visual Intensity:** Personal. Direct to camera. Feels like a 1-on-1 conversation, not an ad.

### Storyboard Format

Every ad uses this two-column storyboard format. This is what gets handed to the video editor or AI avatar tool.

**Format for each ad:**

```
## [FUNNEL STAGE] Ad [N]: [Persona] — [Pain Point]
### Hook Variations (pick one to shoot)

**Hook A ([Category]):** "[Full hook text]"
**Hook B ([Category]):** "[Full hook text]"
**Hook C ([Category]):** "[Full hook text]"

### Storyboard (using Hook A)

| Time | Visual Direction | Script | Text Overlay |
|------|-----------------|--------|-------------|
| 0-3s | [Camera angle, setting, B-roll description] | "[Spoken words]" | [On-screen text, if any] |
| 3-8s | [Visual transition, B-roll] | "[Spoken words]" | [Key phrase or stat] |
| 8-15s | [Visual direction] | "[Spoken words]" | [Supporting text] |
| ... | ... | ... | ... |

### Caption / Post Copy

**Hook:** [First line — must work as a standalone scroll-stopper]
**Body:** [2-3 sentences expanding on the ad's angle]
**CTA:** [Clear action — link in bio, comment X, DM me, etc.]
**Hashtags:** [5-8 relevant hashtags, mix of broad and niche]
```

### Storyboard Rules

- **Visual Direction column** must be specific enough for a videographer or AI avatar tool to execute: camera angle, setting/background, B-roll subject, transitions, speaker position
- **Script column** is the exact spoken words — write for speaking, not reading (contractions, short sentences, conversational rhythm)
- **Text Overlay column** shows what appears on screen — key phrases, stats, CTAs. Not every row needs one.
- **Timing must be realistic.** Count the words in the script column — average speaking pace is 150 words/minute (2.5 words/second). A 3-second hook can fit ~7 words max.
- **One ad = one persona x one pain point.** Never multi-target.
- **B-roll suggestions** should match the emotional tone of the funnel stage: TOFU = relatable/raw, MOFU = educational/credible, BOFU = aspirational/urgent, Retargeting = personal/intimate
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add Phase 3 ad bible with funnel stages and storyboard format"
```

---

### Task 5: Write the 4-Week Testing Protocol section

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the testing protocol**

```markdown
## 4-Week Ad Testing Protocol

Include this section at the end of every ad bible. It tells the user how to deploy, measure, and iterate on the ads.

### Week 1: Launch & Hook Test

**Goal:** Find which hooks stop the scroll. Don't optimize for conversions yet — optimize for attention.

**Actions:**
- Deploy 3-4 TOFU ads with different hook variations
- Budget: $5-10/day per ad
- Run for 5-7 days minimum before making decisions
- Track: Hook rate (% who watch past 3 seconds), video completion rate, engagement rate

**Decision Framework:**
- Hook rate > 25%: Keep running, this hook works
- Hook rate 15-25%: Test a new hook on the same ad body
- Hook rate < 15%: Kill the ad entirely — the hook failed

### Week 2: Optimize & Expand

**Goal:** Kill losers, scale winners, add MOFU ads to catch the warm audience.

**Actions:**
- Kill any TOFU ad below 25% hook rate
- Increase budget 2x on winners
- Launch 2-3 MOFU ads targeting people who watched 50%+ of TOFU ads
- Test hook variations on MOFU (same body, different hooks)
- Track: CTR, cost per click, lead magnet opt-in rate

**Decision Framework:**
- MOFU CTR > 1%: Winner — keep running
- MOFU CTR 0.5-1%: Test new hooks or adjust the mechanism reveal section
- MOFU CTR < 0.5%: Kill — the message isn't resonating with warm audience

### Week 3: Full Funnel & Scale

**Goal:** Activate all funnel stages. Optimize by persona, not just by ad.

**Actions:**
- Launch BOFU ads targeting page visitors and cart abandoners
- Launch retargeting ads for non-converters
- Analyze which persona x pain point combos drive the most conversions
- Double down on winning personas, pause underperformers
- Track: Conversion rate, cost per acquisition, ROAS

**Decision Framework:**
- BOFU conversion > 2%: Scale aggressively
- BOFU conversion 1-2%: Adjust value stack or guarantee messaging
- BOFU conversion < 1%: Landing page problem, not ad problem — check downstream
- Retargeting conversion > 3%: Strong — increase retargeting window
- Retargeting conversion < 3%: Try different angles or new proof points

### Week 4: Refresh & Iterate

**Goal:** Combat ad fatigue. Replace underperformers. Build new creative from winning patterns.

**Actions:**
- Identify ads with declining hook rates (fatigue signal)
- Create new ads using the SAME winning hook categories but fresh scripts
- Test new personas or pain points from your matrix that haven't been used yet
- Review full-funnel metrics: overall cost per acquisition, funnel conversion rate, ROAS
- Document what worked for future ad bibles

**Ad Fatigue Signals:**
- Hook rate dropping week over week
- CPM increasing without audience changes
- Frequency above 3.0 (same person seeing the ad 3+ times)
- Engagement rate declining

**After Week 4:** Repeat the cycle. Weeks 1-4 are a loop, not a one-time process. Each cycle builds on the last — your second ad bible should be better than your first because you know which hooks, personas, and pain points actually convert.
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add 4-week ad testing protocol"
```

---

### Task 6: Write the guardrails and scope boundaries

**Files:**
- Modify: `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Append the rules and scope sections**

```markdown
## Rules

- **Never fabricate proof.** Don't invent testimonials, statistics, results, or data for ad scripts. If proof doesn't exist for a claim, write the ad without that claim or flag it as [NEEDS PROOF] in the storyboard.
- **One persona x one pain point per ad.** Multi-targeting dilutes the message. If an ad tries to speak to two personas, split it into two ads.
- **Hook variations must use different categories.** Three callout hooks isn't three variations — it's one idea said three ways. Each hook on an ad must come from a different hook category.
- **Storyboard timing must be realistic.** Count the words. 150 words/minute speaking pace. A 3-second hook cannot contain a 15-word sentence. If the script doesn't fit the time, cut the script.
- **Kill metrics are guidelines, not absolute rules.** Industry, audience, and platform affect benchmarks. Present them as starting points and tell the user to calibrate based on their own data.
- **Value claims must match user's actual proof.** If a user says "we helped 500 people," the ad can say 500. If they say "a few clients," the ad says "clients" not "hundreds."
- **Apply brand voice when available.** If brand-voice-router is active or the user specifies a brand, apply that voice to all scripts and captions. If no brand context exists, write in clear, direct, conversational tone.
- **Humanize all text output.** Run all scripts and captions through humanize-ai-writing before delivering. AI-sounding ad copy is the fastest way to get skipped.
- **TOFU ads don't sell.** Top of funnel is awareness and pain identification only. No pricing, no CTAs to buy, no "limited time offer." If a TOFU ad starts selling, it's a BOFU ad mislabeled.
- **Retargeting ads need a new angle.** Never repeat the same pitch. If someone didn't convert on the first message, saying it louder won't help. Find a different proof point, objection, or emotional angle.

## What This Skill Does NOT Do

- Design landing pages (separate skill — the ad drives traffic, the page converts it)
- Write email sequences or nurture automations
- Set up ad platform campaigns (Meta Ads Manager, TikTok Ads, YouTube Ads)
- Create the actual video content (record footage, generate AI avatars, edit video)
- Build payment processing or checkout flows
- Write organic social media content (this is paid ad creative only)
```

**Step 2: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md
git commit -m "feat: add guardrails and scope boundaries"
```

---

### Task 7: Package as .skill archive and verify

**Files:**
- Create: `~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/funnel-ad-creator.skill`

**Step 1: Verify the archive format matches existing skills**

Check the structure of an existing .skill archive:

```bash
unzip -l ~/skills/skills/humanize-ai-writing/humanize-ai-writing.skill
```

The format stores files inside a named subdirectory (e.g., `humanize-ai-writing/SKILL.md`).

**Step 2: Package the SKILL.md into a .skill ZIP archive**

```bash
cd /tmp
mkdir funnel-ad-creator
cp ~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md funnel-ad-creator/
zip -r ~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/funnel-ad-creator.skill funnel-ad-creator/
rm -rf funnel-ad-creator
```

**Step 3: Verify the archive contents**

```bash
unzip -l ~/skills/skills/funnel-ad-creator/funnel-ad-creator.skill
```

Expected output should show `funnel-ad-creator/SKILL.md` inside the archive.

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
cd ~/skills && git add skills/funnel-ad-creator/
git commit -m "feat: package funnel-ad-creator skill"
```

---
